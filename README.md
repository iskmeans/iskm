# iskm
iskm contains the iskm algorithm and related experiments for data stream clustering. Each experiment can be executed in matlab with the provided datasets.

1. For the experiments on the synthetic datasets, please run Experiment_synthetic_1_iskmeans.m and Experiment_synthetic_2_iskmeans.m 
2. For the experiments on real-world datasets, please run Experiment_real_life_1_GSA.m and Experiment_real_life_2_GTD.m
3. To see the evolution of clusters over time on real-world datasets, please run Experiment_real_life2_GTD_isk_means_evolution_of_clusters.m and Experiment_real_life1_GSA_isk_means_evolution_of_clusters.m
